# MTech - Dissertation
This repository contains the complete information about the final year project on Time Series analysis investigating th impact of COVID on model forecasts and identifying the ways to improved the model
# Description
The project has been done using the UK house Sales Volume and TFL passenger count datasets and the experiment is performed using 3 specific TS models : ARIMA, SARIMA and Prophet. Provided below are the links to the datasets and the notebooks along with their description:
